How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  1. Allows to locate errors faster as there are few lines compared to the entire codebase
  2. note of line numbers where errors occur

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   1. Ease to track the progress
   2. Codes can be reused

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   1. Pros : careful and informed changes are saved

   2. Cons : One might forget to commit the changes leading to loss of data


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Files like Google docs captures information and not the logic whereas Git captures functional changes and logic.
   Git allows committing multiple files as its more efficient in that way

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can be used to get log of all the commits happened so far and git diff helps in finding difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    as it maintains history of all the changes, one can easily revert to previous version in case of any breakdown

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would record history of the codebase for my petproject
